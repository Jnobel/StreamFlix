**StreamFlix+** is a personal project built as part of a **college assignment** using [The Movie Database (TMDB)](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API to browse, search, and view details about movies.

Built with:
- ⚛️ **React Native + Expo**
- 🔷 **TypeScript**
- 🎨 **Custom components and native styling**

Thanks to TMDB for providing an awesome API that powers this project 🤠
